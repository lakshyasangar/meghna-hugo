To analyse and discover the dependencies and factors that affect the hourly wages of individuals of varying demographics and characteristics was the agenda of this case study, just how much can a particular fact about you can determine your increase or decrease of salary expectation and what exactly do you stand to earn in the UK is our objective.

The variables considered in this case study in our database consist of :

* Marital status
* Years of experience
* Years in education
* Number of dependents

> Hourly wages in the UK depend the most on years of education.

To clean the data, rows corresponding to fields with null values were eliminated, using the drop command on python, which is the language used for this case study.

**Visualisation**

To understand relationships between variables, data visualisation have been produced given below :

The relationship between frequency and hourly wage on the x-axis signify the steep decline from population that have an hourly wage less than 5 with north of 200 to 10 and above with a population just short of 75, clearly suggesting the obvious fact that the number of high wage workers tend to decrease as the wage numbers rise.

This graph highlights the observations about our categorical variables of gender and race, highlighting the presence of male individuals having higher wages than females. It's also worth noticing that despite non-white males have higher overall mean value in the box higher than white males, white males have higher outliers in the graph, suggesting that individually, white males earn the highest of the bunch.
