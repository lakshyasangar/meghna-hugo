Python vs R has been a long running debate about which should be considered the most efficient or effective, when in reality, they are both different in their approach and go far beyond data analytics. Lets take a deeper dive on the more common take of python being a programmers language and R being a statisticians'

Both python and R in their respective latest versions are packed with the most proficient libraries ranging from data visualisation, mining and processing. There is a significant amount of similarities when it comes to the effectiveness of each language in the fields of data science and machine learning. 

> Python integrates software environments easily, R specialises in data science and research.

R is an open-source software programming language developed by statisticians and mathematicians over two decades. R is optimised for statistical analysis and visualisation and is equipped with repositories such as  CRAN which has 1300+ packages for deep analytics. anything that is data oriented can be easily achieved in the integrated R environment. the tidy verse package for data visualisation is much liked by evangelists. One can also prep, train and test machine learning models on R, which is widely used in the analytics industry.

Python is an object-oriented language launched in 1991 and has since been one of the most sort-after choice with programmers and data analyst alike. Python, apart from data analysis, is also used to build websites and software, automate tasks with the added benefit of simple syntax, easy to learn and adapt format. Python is much popular because it is highly productive as compared to other programming languages like C++ and Java. Many common code snippets like sorting, replace and rename functions are pre-defined as functions in python.
